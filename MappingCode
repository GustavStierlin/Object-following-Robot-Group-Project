The following is code that mapped out a set area, The robot will travell in a grid like pattern, and then will send the collected data to the GUI to display a 3D map of the terrain that the robot travelled.

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
from scipy import interpolate

ax = plt.axes(projection = "3d")

def plot(n, arr):
    x_data = np.arange(0, n, 1)
    y_data = np.arange(0, n, 1)
    X, Y = np.meshgrid(x_data, y_data)

    Z = arr

    Z_I = interpolate.interp2d(x_data, y_data, Z, kind="cubic")
    Xnew =np.linspace(0, n, 10)
